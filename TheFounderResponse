the founder is an browser based game that puts the user as a strart up company. The user gets to choose which medium or type of company such as mobile devices, hardware, and other that can be unlocked as you play. You must create the next big device among these types or products and manange everything from the size of the office to who is hired as well as fired. I've never played a simulation game quite like this but since it was assignment I was roughly able to understand the concept of how to progress besides making more money by creating profitable pruducts. The control and all the action I could perform was really cumbersome, especially after the first office up. After sometime it was hard to keep up with the clicking to do every single time. It looked and felt like what I assume what the Sims game but the office/ business version.
