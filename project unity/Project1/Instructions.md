 ##the game that doesnt have a name doesnt have a name

 ## Summary
 the objective is to defeat the other player
 player 1 will control an antivirus that revoles around the platform and the player 2 will control the virus that spawn on the board. the objective is to either destroy the other player. Either the virus or anti virus will have to defeat the other.
 player 1 can win simply by shooting the virus off the platform while to virus player tries to evade and shoot back at the antivirus. If the antivirus take ten hits, the virus player wins.
 i just wanted to make a simple but competitively fast game. i plan to add a dash button and tweek controls to remain loose but accurate so it can give some kind of excitement while featuring tight controls.
