	last week we were trying think of a way that we can use some kind of information from the internet. First thing i thought about was using twitter but im sure there are other things that could be used in its place. I remember back when I was in tennesee we had a sort of bulletin in a local paper to find out if any soldiers was aressted. So I ask, what if you could pull information from a public source like the nypd about aressts and use this to help connect people that are arressted unjustly with this break bail Project that our instructor showed us last week. Another idea i would like to figure outsort of making a cuny announcement board that gives information regarding any and every announcement for each department or major.
