# <b>Review:The Founder<b>

<p>"The Founder" is a browser based game that puts the user as a start up company. The user gets to choose which medium or type of company such as mobile devices, hardware, and others that can be unlocked as you play. You must create the next big device or  kind of products and manange everything from the size of the office to who is hired as well as fired. I've never played a simulation game quite like this but since it was an assignment, I was roughly able to understand the concept of how to progress besides making more money by creating profitable products. The control of all the actions I could perform was really cumbersome, especially after the first office upgrade.I Assume this is sort of what its like to be a manager or business owner. After sometime it was hard to keep track of my progress due to the chaos that is running a business. It looked and felt like what I assume what the Sims game but the office/ business version.<p>
